"""Non-blocking audit log delivery (PLAN.md §5.4).

Commands must never wait on Discord message delivery to the audit channel,
so `AuditService.record()` only enqueues the event; a background worker
drains the queue, batches up to `_MAX_EMBEDS_PER_MESSAGE` audit embeds per
Discord message, and hands them to the `AuditGateway` port.

The service owns embed construction (via `EmbedFactory`) rather than the
gateway: `EmbedFactory` lives under `presentation/`, but the audit embed
format (PLAN.md §5.4) is also needed by other background application
services (e.g. the progression poller in M3) that have no cog to delegate
rendering to. Building it once here, instead of duplicating the field
layout inside `infrastructure/discord/audit_channel.py`, keeps the single
audit format single.
