"""SQLite cache connection and schema migration (see PLAN.md §8.1).

`schema.sql` is written to be idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), so
applying it on every startup is always safe; `sync_meta.schema_version`
records what actually ran, giving future milestones a place to detect and
run real migrations instead of just re-applying the same file.
